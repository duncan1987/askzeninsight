## Data Storage & Security

**Chat History:** Your conversations are securely stored in our database and are linked to your account. You can access, view, or delete your conversations at any time from the chat interface.

**Encryption:** We use industry-standard encryption for data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest to protect your information.

**Access Control:** Only you and authorized Ask Zen Insight personnel have access to your data. We never share your chat content with third parties.

## Payment Processing

All payments are processed by Creem as our merchant of record. We do not store or have access to your full credit card numbers or bank account details. Creem handles all PCI DSS compliance for payment security.

## AI Model & Data Usage

Our Service uses [your ai model] model to generate responses. When you send a message:

- Your message is sent to [your ai model]'s API to generate a response
- The AI does not retain your conversation history beyond the current session
- Your chat content is stored in our database, not used to train the AI model

## Cross-Border Data Transfer

**Important Notice:** When you use our Service, your messages are transmitted to Zhipu AI's servers located in **China** for AI processing. This constitutes a cross-border data transfer from your location to China.

**Data Protection:** We ensure that your data is protected during transmission using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS). Zhipu AI processes your messages solely to generate AI responses and does not use your data for any other purposes, including:

- Training or improving their AI models
- Marketing or advertising purposes
- Selling or sharing with third parties
- Profiling or tracking user behavior

**Your Consent:** By using our Service, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your messages to Zhipu AI's servers in China for the sole purpose of generating AI responses. If you do not agree to this cross-border data transfer, please discontinue use of the Service.

**Data Minimization:** We only transmit the minimum necessary data (your message content) required to generate AI responses. We do not transmit your account information, payment details, or other personal data to Zhipu AI.

## Data Retention & Deletion

**Chat History:** Your conversations are retained until you delete them or delete your account. You can delete individual conversations or your entire account from the chat interface.

**Account Deletion:** Upon account deletion, all your chat history, profile data, and usage records are permanently removed from our systems within 30 days.

**Backup Data:** Backup copies of deleted data may be retained for a limited time for disaster recovery purposes before being permanently deleted.

**Transaction Records:** For tax, financial audit, and fraud prevention purposes, we will retain necessary transaction records (excluding chat content) for at least 5 years after account deletion, or as required by applicable local laws.

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT sell your data.** We only share your information in limited circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** With [your ai model] (for AI response generation), Creem (for payment processing), and Supabase (for data storage) as necessary to provide the Service.
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, court order, or to protect our rights and safety.
- **Business Transfers:** If we are acquired or merge with another company, your data may be transferred as part of the transaction.
