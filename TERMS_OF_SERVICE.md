**Important:** The Service is for informational and reflective purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical, mental health, legal, or financial advice.

AI models may produce hallucinations or inaccuracies. Users are encouraged to independently verify Buddhist and Zen classics, scriptures, and teachings from authoritative sources.

**Service Purpose:** This Service is for entertainment and personal spiritual exploration only. It does not constitute medical advice, psychological counseling, or professional diagnosis.

- **Payment Changes:** We reserve the right to change prices with 30 days notice. Existing subscribers will be notified before any price change takes effect.
- **AI Model Cost Adjustment:** Subscription fees are subject to adjustment in response to changes in third-party AI model pricing and infrastructure costs. As our service relies on external AI providers (including but not limited to [your ai model], OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers), significant fluctuations in their pricing or the introduction of new cost structures may necessitate corresponding adjustments to our subscription fees. Any such adjustments will be made with reasonable notice (minimum 30 days) to existing subscribers, and you will have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new pricing takes effect. We strive to maintain price stability while ensuring sustainable service delivery.
- **Dispute Resolution:** You agree to contact us via [your domain email address] before initiating any disputes with the payment platform. Direct disputes or chargebacks with Creem without prior communication may result in account suspension.

## 7. Cancellation & Refunds
